## Conclusion
Rating on ease of use â€“ We did a Welch Two Sample T-test and we discovered that the p-value does not exceed the 5% significance level. Hence, there is a significant difference in the rating on ease of use between Version A and B. 
However, it was inconclusive whether Version A or Version B was better. As a result, we proceed with a lower tail test and we discovered that the p-value does not exceed the 5% significance level. Thus, there is a significant difference in the rating on ease of use for Version A being higher compared to Version B.
To summarize our analysis, we can deduce that Version A is a better version as it is more user-friendly compared to Version B.
